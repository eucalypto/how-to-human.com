## Get Hugo Executable
This version is build with Hugo:

```bash
how-to-human.com % ./hugo version
hugo v0.105.0-0e3b42b4a9bdeb4d866210819fc6ddcf51582ffa darwin/amd64 BuildDate=2022-10-28T12:29:05Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
```

https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.105.0

On Mac you may get an error starting the binary because it cannot be verified. After this unsuccessful start, go to Mac settings -> Security, and there should be a button to allow the execution of this binary.

I've copied the hugo executable into the root directory of this project, but excluded it from git. You should be able to
download and run the version above. :)

## Theme as submodule

After cloning, you need to load the theme as a submodule.

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

I've forked the theme so that there won't be any unexpected changes for me: https://github.com/eucalypto/beautifulhugo  

Add Parsa theme as submodule:

```bash
/how-to-human.com$ git submodule add git@github.com:eucalypto/parsa-hugo.git themes/parsa-hugo
```


## Deployment
### Local preparations

I can publish the generated html pages from ./public/ into a git repository that I set up at my hoster. For that I need a separate branch named `public`.

Since hugo generates the files into the folder `public`, I can use git worktree to check out the branch into this folder:
```bash
git worktree add public/ public
```

I'm not using git to deploy the site, but it's still good to have the actual "artefact" also versioned here in git. :)

### Actual Deployment
#### Via FTP
I'm using Filezilla and I've created an extra ftp account how-to-human-ftp that I'm using for the credentials. In Filezilla, I've set up the "Explicit FTP over TLS" option, to make the FTP secure. Then I simply have to copy everything from `/public/*` to `/*` on the ftp side.

#### Not via git
My hosting provider allows me to create a git repository that I can push changes to. But it uses the credentials of the single webmaster account. I would like to use separate credentials. So I.m using the FTP solution above.
